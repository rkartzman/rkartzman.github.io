<h3>Tonight's Menu Featuring: A Cultural Journey</h3>

<div class="post">
  When applying to Dev Bootcamp, I sold myself as someone that is both a thinker and a do-er, which I believe is no longer the norm in our society. Certainly there are both thinkers and do-ers but rarely in my opinion do people straddle both.Indeed, my generation (Y) is auspiciously endowed with the tools to be both, but it is a concious choice not an inevitability. My intuition is that Dev Bootcamp's mission is not only to produce competent programmers, but more broadly,to amplify one's personal ambition, to be an architect providing the builder with certain tools and wisdom--inspiration and caution alike.
<p>
My perception of Dev Bootcamp has certainly changed in recent weeks. While it is difficult not to view the intensive nature of the next 20 weeks as some form of a long term investment, my frame of mind is no longer focused on the outcome that will ensue afterwards. Rather, I am eager to see how elastic my bandwith for creation is and how far I can stretch my limits. The unique cultural environment at DBC is designed to enhance this process and as such I am excited to be taking part in it.

<h3>Gittin Jiggy With It</h3>
<p>
  Version Control: Putting it all together
</p>
<p>
Anyone that has seen the movie Memento is familiar with the computer programming concept of "version control." Guy Pearce is Leonard Shelby, suffering from amnesia, relentlessly trying to piece together the events of a murder that resulted in the death of his wife and his subsequent memory loss. Leonard uses Polaroids with snippets of information written on the back to piece together the events of the traumatic robbery. Each photograph and accompanying blurb provides a snapshot into the structure of his life and relationships prior to his injury.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, computer programmers use a system called git, which provides an analogous snapshot into the various versions of the software they have written. Git is a local repository, meaning it is stored on your computer, that harbors all the necessary information for a programmer to be able to track the entire lifespan of their code. In this way, git allows programmers to save their work each time they commit changes to the larger piece while always allowing them to revert back to an earlier version. Thus git provides a medium for virtual time travel in the programming world. Each time the code is saved, a snapshot of the changes is recorded and a quick summary of the modifications accompanies each "commit" to make it easier to sift through several versions.
</p>
<p>
Programmers also benefit from an online repository called GitHub which works seamlessly with git on your computer to manage the many local versions on the computer with the master copy online. This invites teams working collaboratively on a project to continue to work independently without having to worry about potential "traffic jams," or overlaps. Thus GitHub serves as the final copy for any collaborative project and can be extremely beneficial when constantly iterating, resulting in a better product for the end user. Version control is merely one feature of git that makes it an incredibly useful tool for programmers.
