    <h2>What is paired programing?</h2>
    <p> Pair programming is a collaborative effort between two programmers
      working to solve the same problem. Pair programming entails a balance between
      research and execution on behalf of both programmers to achieve the desired objective.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is paired programing important to DBC?</h2>
      <p>Paired programming is important because not only are you learning
      together but it is a very efficient way of solving problems because
      mistakes are more easily realized and both members of the team can
      concentrate on specific tasks while still keeping track of each others work.</p>
