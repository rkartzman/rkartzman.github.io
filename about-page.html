Cultures are like operating systems; to understand a different culture is to completely rewire the software in your brain. I graduated in May with a degree in World Politics from Hamilton College, but have also studied in London and South Africa. I have taught English to refugees from around the world in Utica, NY and in June worked in Northern Ghana to provide clean water to over 4,000 people in less than 3 weeks. No less, backpacking across Southeast Asia and Europe with friends and family has been equally as enlightening. However, of the 196 countries in the world, I haven't even begun to scratch the surface.

UPDATE: My most recent adventure is a deep dive into the world of computer programming. Currently attending Dev Bootcamp in NYC.
