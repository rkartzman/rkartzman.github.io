  <h2>In Tech, (Seldom) Do We Trust</h2>
  <div class= "2">2 Nov 2014</div>
  <hr>
  <p>The single most important problem facing the tech industry right now is trust. Especially now, when the term "tech" is ambiguous itself. How do we define technology in 2014? Surely, tech has evolved from our traditional descriptions most often associated with rocketships, flying cars, computers and mobile phones. Search engines, mobile apps and 140 characters seems to be the focus now. But regardless of how you characterize tech, ultimately the people have lost trust in society's ability to deliver on their promises. Every industry imaginable, from healthcare to financial services to government and national defense increasingly rely on software to store data, carry out fiduciary transactions or even remote military operations through unmanned weapons. In short, technology is unavoidable, frightentingly pervasive. This inevitably blurs the lines between what we as citizens consider to be within the scope of our personal privacy and public information. Rarely do we feel secure entering our information on websites or the reliability of technology to control the security in our homes, whether it is by locking our front door right from our cell phones or entrusting a peer to peer transaction over Airbnb.

On the other hand, I certainly would not trade my uncertainity and mistrust to not be able to participate in the technology economy. In order to reap the benefits, I forgo the occasional anxiety and proceed with an heir of caution. Citizens globally are overwhelmingly disenchanted by their elected(sometimes) officials ability to deliver on their promises. We have seen this throughout the world, and I would argue technology has been instrumental in creating greater transparency between governments and their citizens. The beneficiaries of the Arab Spring understand the tradeoffs between "privacy" and individual liberty all too well.

Thus the underlying problem may appear on the surface to reside in the evolution of technological innovation, but the solution is never to regress; Voltaire is particularly enlightening here. The issue is fundamentally a societal one, coincidentally we are living in a software dominated society. One answer is to reverse time to an era prior to our current technologically dependent selves, to avoid the pitfalls of a more connected/less secure society. According to that logic, individuals were better off before they were inundated with fancy gadgets; life was simpler and society was more secure.  Conversely, I wholeheartedly believe that the tech industry is the best equipped to handle these issues. The answer is greater technological innovation, not an unrealistic nostalgia for the past.

I hope to return to this topic, which I think is worth exploring deeper, but in an effort to timebox myself I broadly covered only a few issues. Until part II...

<h2>Tonight's Menu Featuring: A Cultural Journey</h2>
<div class="2">10 Oct 2014</div>
<hr>
<p>
  When applying to Dev Bootcamp, I sold myself as someone that is both a thinker and a do-er, which I believe is no longer the norm in our society. Certainly there are both thinkers and do-ers but rarely in my opinion do people straddle both.Indeed my generation (Y) is propitiously endowed with the ability to be both, but it is a concious choice not an inevitability. My intuition is that Dev Bootcamp's mission is not only to produce competent programmers, but more broadly,to amplify one's personal ambition, to be an architect providing the builder with certain tools and wisdom--inspiration and caution alike.
</p>
<p>
  My perception of Dev Bootcamp has certainly changed in recent weeks. While it is difficult not to view the intensive nature of the next 20 weeks as some form of a long term investment, my frame of mind is no longer focused on the outcome that will ensue afterwards. Rather, I am eager to see how elastic my bandwith for creation is and how far I can stretch my limits.

<h2>Gittin Jiggy With It</h2>
<div class="2">10 Oct 2014</div>
<hr>

  Anyone that has seen the movie Memento is familiar with the computer programming concept of "version control." Guy Pearce is Leonard Shelby, suffering from amnesia, relentlessly trying to piece together the events of a murder that resulted in the death of his wife and his subsequent memory loss. Leonard uses Polaroids with snippets of information written on the back to piece together the events of the traumatic robbery. Each photograph and accompanying blurb provides a snapshot into the structure of his life and relationships prior to his injury.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, computer programmers use a system called git, which provides an analogous snapshot into the various versions of the software they have written. Git is a local repository, meaning it is stored on your computer, that harbors all the necessary information for a programmer to be able to track the entire lifespan of their code. In this way, git allows programmers to save their work each time they commit changes to the larger piece while always allowing them to revert back to an earlier version. Thus git provides a medium for virtual time travel in the programming world. Each time the code is saved, a snapshot of the changes is recorded and a quick summary of the modifications accompanies each "commit" to make it easier to sift through several versions.
</p>
<p>
Programmers also benefit from an online repository called GitHub which works seamlessly with git on your computer to manage the many local versions on the computer with the master copy online. This invites teams working collaboratively on a project to continue to work independently without having to worry about potential "traffic jams," or overlaps. Thus GitHub serves as the final copy for any collaborative project and can be extremely beneficial when constantly iterating, resulting in a better product for the end user. Version control is merely one feature of git that makes it an incredibly useful tool for programmers.
