  <h2>How The Internet Works</h2>
  <div>27 Nov 2014</div>
  <hr>
  <p>"When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole.  We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance.  Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do his will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone.  A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket."
   --Nikola Tesla, 1926 on the future of the Internet.</p>

If I'm ever curious about the answer to something, can't remember the name of that actor in that movie, or having a dinner table debate about the population of New York City, my first instinct is to search for the answer on Google. There is no time spent considering the best possible options to retrieve this type of information. Sometimes I have to remind my parents or relatives of an older generation of this luxury during times of intellectual curiousity.

I was more or less born into this era, a digital native of sorts, and so this process of information gathering and curation is innate. Which means that while I can do it without having to think, unfortunately I don't actually think about what I'm doing. Therefore I don't truly understand how the machine operates under the hood when I query my medical ailments into a search engine to WebMD to get a list of explaining everything that's wrong with me. In other words, I know how to drive the car pretty well, I know what type of fuel it needs to maintain a good bill of health and can probably change the oil or swap out a flat if I'm stranded on the side of the road. But if I'm going take this journey into front end web development seriously, I should probably make friends with a few mechanics.

So, in an effort to understand how the internet works I am writing a blog post detailing a few aspects of the internet that might give me a better idea of what's really going on underneath the surface.

There a few pieces that are critical this process:
1. each computer has a unique address called an IP address
2. The ISP, or internet service provider, maintains a pool of modems for their customers. This is managed by some form of computer which controls the data flows from the modem pool to a backbone or a dedicated line router.
3. Browsers send requests to the server it has to connect to an ip configurations which is basically another computer. when you request google.com the server will send a response.

In general, the Internet is a massive network of networks all communicating through computers. They interact through certain lines of communication at different speeds. Routers are the traffic control center that assist computers to reach their desired destination.

Today, we only think in terms of the World Wide Web, because it is the easiest and most user friendly way to access these networks of information. The World Wide Web is actually just a medium to display all this information. Prior to the web, there were various other mediums such as gopher and telnet. The World Wide Web is what a user accesses when they type www. into the browser to search for a site. In order to display the information contained on the web, a computer sends a request to the server. The response, thanks to the software contained within the browser, is in the form of HTML documents. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Hypertext is essentially what enables users to click on links and icons to access different web pages. The browser itself is actually a graphical interface made up of tremendously handy software that allows the user to click on those icons.

Most people tend to conflate a lot of these topics, however it is useful to think about them as independent parts operating syngerstically to produce the outcome we are accustomed to when we search on Google.

Similarly, Google is merely a search engine that surfs the entire web for certain keywords. The results it provides are all the Web pages containing those key words. For the most part, we typically encounter what we're looking for within the first page of results, but there are thousands of potential matches.

Internet Connection:
What to say when it takes literally like 5 years just to load a video of Justin Bieber 30,000 ft in the sky:

Internet Connection is getting into the more nitty gritty territory of how this whole information network operates. "The Net" is just a unfathomably massive network of computers/smartphones/smartwatches/tablets/carbon monoxide detectors that are connected to the internet through wires and increasingly wireless. All of these connections are owned privately by ISPs(hot topic: net neutrality). ISPs handle all the modems that take in requests from users, as well as the flow, or speed, at which that request is processed. These reqeusts are also "routed" to an even more central hub, or ISP backbone that the service provider buys their bandwith from. Usually the farther a request has to travel, say across continents, the more hops it takes to different servers in order to get closer to a more centrally located server that can respond to the request. It's important not to confuse server request speed with download speed. These are two distinct speeds at which we access information from our devices and will be covered in a future post. A few key abbreviations below.

Quick Reference Guide to internet abbreviations:
.com -- commercial entity(companies)
URL -- Uniform Resource Locator. each part of a URL provides information about the Web Page.
.net -- Internet Service Providers
