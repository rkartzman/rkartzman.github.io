<h2>Barriers to Entry in HTML/CSS</h2>

  Any self-proclaimed wine connoisseur could taste the difference between a fifteen-year-old merlot and the cheap water-downed stuff you find in a plastic bag. Hopefully, the Secretary of State could easily breakdown the fundamental divide between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. Classes and IDs are equally as as essential to any programmer's lexicon.

  HTML is the backbone of any webpage you visit on the internet. "Tags" or selectors are the so-called exoskeleton that give it its very structure. CSS is able to communicate with HTML by defining the properties of these tag elements, providing a website with the meat and bones and ultimately its visual aesthetics. HTML is rather limited however in the amount of tags the language contains. For the most part webpages are broken up into headers, titles, paragraphs and lists. But, there is no limit to the amount of flair CSS can provide by qualifying tags with classes and IDs. In very much the same way that wine is produced in a finite amount of colors, red, white, and perhaps yellow, there is an array of reds, different blends from different regions, that grow different grapes, and thus producing very distinct flavors. Assigning a class to a tag in html is like defining a wine as red. It can be applied to a number of different tags in a number of different ways. An ID on the other hand, literally identifies a unique product, like a Port, which is derived only from grapes grown in Portugal. Therefore when an ID is applied to an element it is assigning a unique identity that cannot be applied anywhere else. It would be equally as improper to call a wine from Italy or California. However, you could say that all three are of the same class, in that they are red, and thus share similar qualities. If your intuition is telling you that it is almost always "safer" to use a class instead of an ID you would be correct, because classes have a much broader application and for basic web-design a lower probability of ruining your pages functionality. The distinction is subtle and tricky, but an essential stepping stone towards a good workflow in html and css.
