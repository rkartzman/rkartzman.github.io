<h3>Optimists Prime</h3>
<p>
"There are people who are wired to be skeptics and there are people who are wired to be optimists," according to Marc Andreessen, the high-profile Silicon Valley venture capitalist, entrepeneur, and ideologue. Andreessen has a theory about success: "optimists" prevail. I was drawn to this controversial logic because upon first glance it seems very deterministic about success, that inherently some people approach the future with a degree of optimism or skepticism. But upon further inspection, however, it is exactly the opposite. Optimism is a choice--it lives and thrives on our daily behavior, the way we phrase questions, and the way in which we choose to answer those questions.
</p>
It stands to reason that the so-called optimists of the world likely carry the same approach to their views on careers, work and life similar to what Carol Dweck would categorize as the "growth mindset."
<p>
Indeed even in my own experience, the internal skeptic or deterministic voice is easy to succumb to. It is decidedly easier to choose the safe route, the one that will work in spite of effort, struggle and despair. It convinces us to quit, deluding our thinking into one that believes we are not cut out of for this type of work. That is the same voice that compelled me to avoid quantitative classes throughout college, and to cling helplessly to history, philosophy and political science.

</p>
Alas, I'm not qualified to be a software engineer. It certainly doesn't come naturally to me, and is hardly the easiest path for me to choose. My abstract sequential learning styles can handle the theoritical underpinnings of software engineering no problem. The practical application will take work though, hard work.
<p>
But I can't help but override those thoughts in my head with the question: "What if it does work? What if I actually am great at programming?" The answer to that question has a lot more potential than the scripted future of the path of least resistance.
