Socrates was famous for his precise method of asking questions in order to arrive at the truth. Most of Plato's writing are in the form of dialogues between his mentor Socrates and a character of classical Greek society of perceived wisdom. The conversation usually concludes with Socrates, through deductive reasoning and pointed questioning, convince the public figure that the conclusions they hold to be true are indeed incorrect.

The internet we know today, or rather the idea of the search engine in general is built on the notion of asking questions and receiving a response from someone or some source that might provide some context towards your enlightenment.

When we search for information on Google or Yahoo, to some extent we query the answer. You have to know what you are looking for in order to get the proper answer. While it is entirely possible to arrive at a biography of Ernest Hemingway, it is unlikely that you will get there unless you ask the right question, "Who wrote the book For Whom the Bell Tolls?"

Incidentally, I very recently came across the blog of the guy who started Stack Overflow, Jeff Atwood, which is an enourmous online forum for people who have questions about code they are writing. All of the answers are contributed by users of the site, people who have experienced similar problems themselves and came across potential solutions.

In other words its a question and answer site, and all of the participants are programmers. Like the internet itself, stack overflow is exceedingly large, therefore in order to get an answer it is critical to ask the right questions.

Atwood blogged about his initial intentions for the site, writing that in his mind he always viewed software development as a "collaborative game, where the only way to win is to learn from each other."

As a sidenote, I find my encounter with all of this to be ironic and oddly serendipitious, but hey the internet is cool like that sometimes.

Stack Overflow is in essence the modern Socratic dialogue for programmers. The wisest and most skilled continue to ask questions not out of ignorance but out of true understanding of the problem and a clear vision of the path to a solution.

Moving forward towards my plunge into software development I am going to be concious of the way in which I phrase my questions, to look for answers to smaller pieces of the big puzzle in order to construct a more visible end product.
