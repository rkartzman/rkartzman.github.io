<h3>Unpretentious Observations of Classes, in Ruby </h3>

<p>
  Less than a week ago, I had a really poor grasp of how to create classes in Ruby. While I had done some reading in David Black's "Well Grounded Rubyist" and my due diligence of online research, it is really difficult for me to commit these practices to muscle memory unless I am actually in the muck getting my hands dirty with some code. Naturally I felt overwhelmed and stifled by these abstractions of the Ruby language. Thus, I needed to go back to the building blocks of the language to make sure I understood these core concepts. And by this I mean literal square one, kindergarten show-and-tell philosophical discussions about characteristics and behaviors of real-world physical objects. And in terms of relateable objects, there are few things more universal than a car. I can't take full credit for this example, it is somewhat hackneyed, and I collaborated with a DBC mentor on this one, but it is really enlightening when learning the basics of creating our own classes in Ruby. Before even diving into Class specifics, its important to look at objects in terms of their properties and behaviors. First, ask questions such as What is car? Generally, what do all cars have? And what does a car do?

What is a car?
* Wheels, doors, seats, windows, engine, gears, etc. <--- has-a relationship defines composition

What do all cars have?
* Make, model, color, mileage, year <-- properties of a car | instance variables

What does a car do?
* drives, carry things, stop <-- behaviors | instance methods

Without having even coded anythign yet, we have a general idea of what our class of Cars would look like and a roadmap of where the code might take us. Based on these descriptions we have already defined what our properties are. These data will be contained within our instance variables. And on the other hand, we have defined the specific behaviors that cars have. These data will be contained within our instance methods. Another way to think about instance variables, is to think of them in terms of reusable bits of code that provide information about them that the methods can in turn use in order to carry out specific behaviors.

In the car class, we said that make, model, color and year were all properties of the class car, but would need to be further defined in order to refer to a specific car. The next step would be to create methods, or behaviors, for the car class so that when we further specificy some of the characteristics of our car, the method can take that information and generate those given behaviors. Perhaps the car might drive, and maybe count mileage.

In Ruby the aforementioned car class would look something like this:

class Car

    def initialize(make,model,color,year)
        @make = make
        @model = model
        @color = color
        @year = year
    end

    def drive(num_of_miles)
        mileage += num_of_miles
    end
end

my_jeep = Car.new("Jeep","Patriot","silver",2014)
my_jeep.drive
my_jeep.color

The bit after closing the class is how you create a new object of that class. The syntax is:
 obj = Obj.new

 You can see where the specific attributes are defined in the new object my_jeep. "Jeep", "Patriot", "silver", 2014 are the instance variables which are specific to the object my_jeep, but when the car class methods are called upon my_jeep it behaves in the same way any car of the car class would. Such is the utility of creating classes in programs. It allows you to define methods and variables that generally speaking are universal to all the objects of that class. By the same token, convertibles and pickup trucks drive in the way any car does, and they all have four wheels and use gas, but there are various makes, models and years for those types of cars. Creating classes adds to the logical flow of a program, instead of detracting from it. It makes the code readable to someone who might not know without reading every line of code what the method drive is referring to, but after seeing that it belongs to a certain class, has a much better understanding of what the outcome of the code might be.
