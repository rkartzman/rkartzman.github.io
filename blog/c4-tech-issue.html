<h3>In Tech, (Seldom) Do We Trust</h3>
<h4>"Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good"
--Voltaire</h4>

<p>
The single most important problem facing the tech industry right now is trust. Especially now, when the term "tech" is ambiguous itself. How do we define technology in 2014? Surely, tech has evolved from our traditional descriptions most often associated with rocketships, flying cars, computers and mobile phones. Search engines, mobile apps and 140 characters seems to be the focus now. But regardless of how you choose to characterize tech, ultimately the people have lost trust in society's ability to deliver on its promises, and somehow technology has somehow become the scapegoat. But unfortunately for those reluctant to adapt, every industry imaginable, from healthcare to financial services to government and national defense increasingly relies on software to store data, carry out fiduciary transactions and even conduct remote military operations through unmanned weapons. In short, technology is unavoidable, frightentingly pervasive. This inevitably blurs the lines between what we as citizens consider to be within the scope of our personal privacy and public information. Rarely do we feel secure entering our information on websites or the reliability of technology to control the security in our homes, whether it is by locking our front door right from our cell phones or entrusting a peer to peer transaction over Airbnb.

On the other hand, I certainly would not trade my occasional uncertainity and mistrust to not be able to participate in the technology economy. In order to reap the benefits, I forgo the occasional anxiety and proceed with an heir of caution. To be sure, citizens globally are overwhelmingly disenchanted by their elected(sometimes) officials ability to deliver on their promises, but conversely praise technology for enlightening them of constitutional negligence. We have seen this throughout the world, and I would argue technology has been instrumental in creating greater transparency between governments and their citizens. The beneficiaries of the Arab Spring understand the tradeoffs between "privacy" and individual liberty all too well.

Thus the underlying problem may appear on the surface to reside in the evolution of technological innovation; in most cases the solution is never to regress; Voltaire is particularly enlightening here. The issue is fundamentally a societal one, coincidentally and irrevocably, we are living in a software dominated society. One answer is to go back in time--prior to our technologically dependent selves--to avoid the pitfalls of a more connected/less secure society. According to that logic, individuals were better off before they were inundated with fancy gadgets; life was simpler and society was more secure.  Conversely, I wholeheartedly believe that the tech industry is the best equipped to handle these issues. The answer is greater technological innovation, not an unrealistic nostalgia for the past.

I hope to return to this topic, which I think is worth exploring deeper, but in an effort to timebox myself I broadly covered only a few issues. Until part II...</p>
