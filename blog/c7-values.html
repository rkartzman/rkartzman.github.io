<h3>My Personal Source Code</h3>

<p>
Leading up to my college graduation, and shortly thereafter, my biggest flaw was ironically the value I find most important to me now. Curiousity and adventure(intellectual and physical) have become part of my personal constitution throughout my early adulthood. It is the reason I chose a liberal arts education, and the reason I so heavily emphasize the experience of travelling and doing activities outside of one's comfort zone. While others quickly reduce this to a lack of focus, or indecisiveness, I think it is absolutely essential to have the curiousity to dabble in areas I know very little about. Those invaluable experiences have shaped my worldview, humbled me, and serendipitously introduced me to people much wiser than me. Which is why I hope to continue to live by this creed, to constantly pursue areas that interest me, regardless of whether it seems "practical" at the moment.

Part of this personal philosophy inherently involves adopting the mentality of "what's the worst that could happen." I prefer the positive converse: regardless of the outcome, there is some discernible benefit. Adopting this mentality eliminates failure as an option because it rewards effort and it elevates the experience and the process above the outcome.

At DBC, it will be easy to fall victim to the trap of using one's classmates as perfomance indicators. This is a terrible strategy and will always result in effacing oneself. It will be critical to remember that everyone is on their own journey towards an irrelevant and independent outcome. It would be impossible and inhuman for us to be evaluated in a vaccuum on our relative capabilities, and therefore it is useless to think about the experience outside of our personal growth and development.
