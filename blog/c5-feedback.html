<h3>Feedback, Pairing and Growth</h3>

<p>
  Pairing and feedback are both vital components of the DBC experience as well as the journey towards becoming an adequate programmer. In most aspects of life, feeback is ironically something we tend to fear despite it being so valuable to our own personal growth. It's frightening to hear other people criticize your work and the tremendous effort that went into producing it. But in learning to program, I have found it to be indispensible. That vulnerability that I am accustomed to feeling has seemed much less important in recent weeks. I find myself feeling more comfortable with the criticism/or praise I receive from my colleagues. Part of this has to do with the feedback model provided by DBC, which requires comments about fellow cohorts to be Actionable, Specific, and Kind. The tripartite formula makes for truly cosntructive criticism that helps frame each suggestion as soemthing that is a natural part of the growing process, instead of a damning and fatalistic encapsulation of your programmer identity.

  There is a piece by Ira Glass, in my opinion one of the greatest storytellers of this generation, who explains this so called "gap" between your "killer taste" and the not so great work that you are producing. He argues that everyone goes through this trough and the only way to bring your work up to the level of your taste, is counterintuitively, to do a lot of work.

  It can be incredibly discouraging to continually do work that you know is inadequate(at least according to your killer taste), however paired programming and receiving feedback has motivated me to keep putting my work out there and to work through challenges with my colleagues. This inevitably leads to a better understanding of the creative process, and an even clearer and obvious comprehension of your thoughts. The ability to have a fresh set of eyes look at your logic and point out gaps/inconsistencies is invaluable to making breakthroughs and avoiding going down the proverbial rabbit hole.
