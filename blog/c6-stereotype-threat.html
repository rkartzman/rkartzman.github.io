<h3>Thoughts on Stereotype Threats</h3>

<p>
 The idea of the stereotype threat, introduced by psychologist Claude Steele offers a counterintuitive explanation to why certain groups, particularly minorities, underperform. While many of his studies have focused on standardized test results among women and African Americans, his theories can extend far beyond testing to individual underperformance in various aspects of life.

I don't think it would be very difficult for anyone to think of a social setting in their own lives in which they felt fearful of how others might perceive them. This manifests in a fear of being considering incompetent in one's profession or even around the family dinner table when a discussion arises about a current event.

Even thoughout college I was always hesitant to chime in on class discussions, holding my comments in for a time when I could engage in the discourse with absolute conviction in my points.

As a social species, we all at some point experience this fear of confirming the negative stereotypes that colleagues, friends and family may have about us. There is a fear of being found out, of others realizing what they assumed to be true all along, that we are inadequate. Whether or not these stereotypes actually exist outside the boundaries of our own minds is unrelated to the idea that the negative environments we create on our own are self-limiting to our personal growth and development. On a societal scale, this theory can perhaps inform many of the debates regarding gender and race disparities in the workplace. The absence of women filling roles at technology companies is currently one of the most contentious issues in Silicon Valley, and the stereotype of the white frat boy culture at tech companies continues to stir the proverbial pot.

Claude Steele's research can ironically be a source of comfort if one allows it. While a lot is left open to interpretation as well as placing the honus on society to cultivate environments in the classroom and the workplace to minimize the presence of those negative stereotypes, there is a great deal of honus placed on the individual to be cognizant of how detrimental these negative stereotypes can be to our personal success and thus being proactive about ignoring them. Putting too much effort into proving others wrong would be to swim upstream. The ability to control the internal dialogue is a difficult skill, but one that can having massive upsides for our personal success and happiness.
