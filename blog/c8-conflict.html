  <p>"If you can't feed a team with two pizzas, it's too large"
    --Jeff Bezos</p>

Immediately after I graduated from college I travelled to Northern Ghana to take part in implementing a water treatment business that would serve as a sustainable source of clean drinking water to a rural village. There were around 30 individuals volunteering through this organization. We were divided into small groups and each assigned one village that we would work closely with over the course of the program.

The villages are small self-sufficient communities, but they usually do not exceed 60-70 people. Including our translator, our group consisted of four people. I was the only male on the team. Northern Ghana is heavily Muslim, and a patriarchal dominated society. For this reason, I was typically the one leading the formal negotiations between our team and the chief and elders of the village.

It is fairly uncommon for young twenty somethings to travel to an austere environment with very little support. In my own observations, most of the people volunteering with me were motivated, ambitious and comfortable leaving their comfort zones. And the villagers were ecstatic to have each of there to help in any capacity we could.

Thus, every opportunity to interact with the villagers was a chance to shine, to be the Lebron James playing in a basketball tournament in China.

While there were never any flare ups or team arguments, there was tension boiling--which is sometimes worse. Perhaps it was a non-existent power struggle of my own imagination, negligeble in size and reality. But it inevitably lead to departmentalization of group roles instead of an equitable power sharing dynamic.

I think I personally could have done a better job of vocalizing my goals and expectations of what leadership roles I wanted to fill.

I handled the situation by subtly directing the spotlight in my teammates direction during other tasks throughout the implementation of the water business. My intention was to make each member of the group feel indispensible to some part of the process and to feel needed by the villagers.

I regret not having that discussion with everyone at the first sign of a division of responsibilities.

When working in teams in the future, I find it crucial to be concisious of individual personalities within the group. This will have major implications for the cohesiveness of the team. Addressing individual concerns, expecatitions and desired responsibilities early on can go a long way in maintaining the team synergy before it unintentionally degenerates into a top-down "works-for" instead of "works-with" mentality devoid of ego.
