<h3>Java Jolt: First Impressions of the language of the Web</h3>

<p>
  Over the past several weeks I've been getting acquainted with the Ruby programming language as part of my phase-0 prep work for Dev Bootcamp. My Ruby coding skills are still dubious; I can build some basic programs, like an underwhelming and not so practical, virtual grocery shopping list. I reached a proficiency level on par with ordering pizza in Italy. It probably sounds insulting, but it gets the job done.

Over the past week, I've put a hold on my Ruby acquisition and made a transition to JavaScript, often heralded as the de facto "language of the web". Upon first inspection, JavaScript looks something of a burden with its decidedly long form syntax compared to the eloquent Ruby.

My impression with JavaScript has ironically been really enjoyable. I don't have a CS background, and for my entire undergrad career, conciously avoided any type of mathematical thinking. Programmers will often declare that you don't need to be good at math in order to code. This is largely true. Even a superficial understanding of mathematical operations will suffice in the programming world. But there is a mathematical style of thinking involved that takes some adjusting to, breaking problems into digestible bits that each serve an independent purpose.

Ruby is regarded by beginners as very relatable to the English language. Sometimes this can be overwhelming when Ruby offers a variety of ways to say the same thing. Thus JavaScript becomes the formulaic alternative that requires more detailed and less flexible syntax. Unfortunately, when you want just want pizza and while "I want pizza", "Pizza I want", and "want Pizza me" will likely result in a satiated appetite, sometimes it would be easier if there were just one correct combination of words.

JavaScript provides that proper structure to me.

In Ruby, in order to create a Hash data structure you would write:

<pre><code>
h = {}
h['a'] = 1
h['b'] = 2

h.each {|key, value| puts "#{key} #{value}" }
</code></pre>

Creating a Hash in JS is almost identical:
<pre><code>
var h = {};
h['a'] = 1;
h['b'] = 2;

for (key in h) { console.log(key, h[key]); }
</code></pre>

Manipulating the hash is nearly the same as well.
But the real differences between the two languages do not bear themselves out between objects of the same type. If we look back at the Ruby syntax for creating a Hash, it is also remarkably similar to the way simple objects are created in JavaScript. For example to create a store object in JavaScript the proper syntax would be:

<pre><code>
var store = {
  name: "Coffeeshop",
  items: 40,
  typesAvailable: 10,
  fairTrade: true
}
</code></pre>

the properties of the store object each have a key and value similar to how a hash stores that data.

Ruby may have a more succinct way of creating objects, but to me it seems logical to simulatenously define an object alongside its properties in this fashion, similar to how an architect would draw up a blueprint for a house that will later be modified.

I'm sure as I progress I will revert back to my affection for concise Ruby syntax, but for the time being I'm liking the structured environment in JavaScript. To each his own. Time will tell.
